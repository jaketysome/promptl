# ðŸŽ¨ Promptl

**Promptl** is an AI image prompt guessing game inspired by the mechanics of Wordle. Each round, an AI-generated image is shown, and your task is to guess the original prompt that was used to create it. You get 6 attempts, word-by-word feedback, and a clue after 3 tries. Think you can outsmart the AI?

  - â¬œ **White**: Word is not in the prompt at all
